Pro Football Deathpool program.  This program will manage a deathpool for the current 2023 NFL season.  Each week a player will choose 1 team as his pick for the week.  You're only allowed to choose a team 1 time during the season.  If your pick for the current week wins, you will advance to the next week. If your team loses you're eliminated from the game.  The players with winning picks for the week will advance to the next weeks games.   The game continues until there's 1 winner left.  For example, should you choose the Packers to win in week 1, and you survive to week 5 you're not allowed to choose the Packers again.
